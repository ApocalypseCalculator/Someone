## ABOUT THE BOT

The legendary Someone bot for Discord. Brings back Discord's 2018 April Fools joke. Created by ApocalypseCalculator#7096.

## WHAT THE BOT DOES

When you mention the bot, it will randomly mention some other server member *who can see the channel*. It also has a lot of other commands you can get by doing `someone!help`.

## SELF-HOSTING

1. You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

2. Clone this repository onto your PC (`git clone https://github.com/ApocalypseCalculator/Someone`).

3. In the folder called `data`, open the file called `token.js`.

4. Inside the `token.js` file, put your bot token inside the `""` and save the file.

5. Before running, make sure you have installed the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the bot's root directory (npm should come with node, if it does not, seperately install npm).

6. Go to your terminal, head to the root bot folder directory (`cd filepath`), and run the `npm run start` command.

**The bot has been upgraded to comply with the newest Discord.js v13!**

## USING THE BOT

This bot duplicates the @Someone April Fools joke. To use it, simply ping the bot (you should name the bot Someone to make it simple).

You can use `someone!commands` for a list of commands.

If you get a *webhook max length exceeded* error message, simply run the command `someone!webhookclear` to clear out the webhooks.

Make sure to grant the bot admin privileges or it may not run properly.

If there are any bugs, feel free to contact me through Discord at `ApocalypseCalculator#7096`.

**You can find a hosted version of this bot at [top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/705135432588853288), and while you're there, please vote for my bot.**

## LICENSING AND LEGAL STUFF

I hate legal stuff, you can read the license if you want to. 
The gist of it is: you may host my bot, but you may not modify my code in any way except for the `token.js` file.
If you want to modify my bot outside of those lines, you would need to contact me through Discord at `ApocalypseCalculator#7096` to gain my approval *before* making any changes.
If you are going to take parts of the code for your own purposes, you must notify me *and* credit me.
