# Someone
**ABOUT ME AND HOW TO RUN**

Someone bot for Discord. Brings back Discord's 2018 April Fools joke.

What this bot basically does is that when you mention it, it will randomly mention some other server member who can see the channel. It also has a lot of other commands you can get by doing `someone!help`

Created by ApocalypseCalculator#7096.

To host this bot. You need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Clone this repository onto your pc. In the bot folder `data`, open the file called token.js

Inside the token.js file, put your bot token inside the `""`. save the file.

before running, make sure you installed the required dependencies by doing `npm install`  (npm should come with node, if it does not, seperately install npm)

if you have node installed, go to your terminal, head to bot folder directory (`cd filepath`), and run the `node .` command.

Bot has been upgraded to comply with the newest Discord.js v12



**Using the bot**

This bot duplicates the @Someone April Fools joke. To use it, simply ping the bot (you should name the bot Someone to make it simple).

You can use someone!commands for commands

If you get a webhook max length exceeded error message, simply run the command someone!webhookclear to clear out the webhooks and everything should be back to normal

Also make sure to grant the bot admin priveledges or it may not run properly

**Licensing and legal stuff**

I hate legal stuff, you can read the license if you want to. 
The gist of it is: you may host my bot, but you may not modify my code in any way except for token.js
If you want to modify my bot outside of those lines, you would need to contact me through Discord at ApocalypseCalculator#7096 to gain my approval *before* making any changes.
If you are to take parts of the code for your own purposes, you must notify me *and* credit me.
