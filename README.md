# Someone
**ABOUT ME AND HOW TO RUN**

Someone bot for Discord. Brings back Discord's 2018 April Fools joke.

Created by ApocalypseCalculator.

To host this bot. Clone this repository onto your pc. In the bot folder holding index.js, open the file called token.js

Inside the token.js file, put your bot token inside the `""`. save the file.

if you have node installed, go to command prompt, head to bot folder directory, and run the `node index.js` command.

if it is not working, delete the node modules folder, re-initialize the node project with `npm init`, and install the 2 required dependencies with the commands `npm install discord` and `npm install express`

make sure discord.js is v11.5.1 and express.js is v4.17.1


**Using the bot**

This bot duplicates the @Someone April Fools joke. To use it, simply ping the bot (you should name the bot Someone to make it simple).

You can use someone!info for commands and troll other people by telling them to use the someone!help command >:)

If you get a webhook max length exceeded error message, simply run the command someone!webhookclear to clear ouot the webhooks and everything should be back to normal

Also make sure to grant the bot admin priveledges or it may not run properly

If there are any bugs feel free to contact me through Discord at ApocalypseCalculator#7096
